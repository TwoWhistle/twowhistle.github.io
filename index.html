    2/14/25 12:33pm  Update on my walking fast everywhere new years resolution - its going well. Think ive only been passed like 3 times. Some dumbass mf tried to pass me walking up a hill last night so I sped up, then he slowed down to let me get back in front, so I pulled the classic match his speed so we have to awkwardly walk next to each other. Went on for like a minute - he basically slowed to the point where we weren't walking anymore so I just passed him.

    2/10/25 3:57pm Jhu is supposed to be where the next generation of top tier doctors comes from. having been in classes with these mfs for a year, I'm confident that 50% of them will be replaced by ai before I die - ill make that shit happen ong. I'll literally turn your salary into the cost of a couple api tokens. I look around in class thinking about which 50% will be spared and I feel like fucking thanos

    2/10/25 3:40pm Update on the lecture recorder, just ordered parts. Ive been thinking about this more, and what irks me the most is that acting like teaching is a commodity is a fundamental misunderstanding. Students can learn organic chemistry on their own whenever they want. They come to class and take pictures of everything not to learn but to do better on tests, because they know that this is the kind of class that rewards kids more for memorizing everything the teacher says - all based around an inflated value in your own teaching. Also posting backtests with no answer keys is crazy. Im so curious for the explanatory backstory

    2/9/25 5:34pm To train a super minimal mvp, im self labeling my own eeg data, which I feel pretty good about, with regards to productivity, attention, sleep, distractedness, etc. But I am pretty genuinely concerned about getting usable labeled data for emotions, like I don't know if I am aware enough of my emotions to self report, even to train a super minimal mvp...hmmmm where I can find a source of hyper emotional data...I wonder how she'll take this lol

    2/7/25 10:43am You know a class will be easy if the prof has to make it artificially harder by not posting the slides. Its kinda crazy she still does this. Shes a good teacher, but something must be wrong when your students are taking pictures of every slide instead of tsking notes. I guess the easy way i should solve this problem is to go to class and pay attention, or pay for Ramy's next nic and get all his notes from last year. But i could also do like a little arc here - an anti-authoriatarian kinda thing and do something the school is against to help me and my fellow students learn. The idea in mind is pretty simple, a raspberry pi with a webcam to record lectures and slides. The execution seems pretty easy too, except that id be mounting on the projector, which is 20 feet in the air in the middle of a lecture hall, and id have to siphon some power from the projectors power cable to the raspberry pi. Hmmmm maybe Ill take a closer look at the room some other time and see how Id do this.

    2/6/25 8:15pm I'm a little more excited about this idea than id like to admit. Theres no way mfs like gary vee haven't thought of this, but I think there could be a new trend where people have their own personal websites, with full control over aesthetics and layouts, thanks to ai. I think its kind of weird, almost depressing how current social media websites force you to have the same profile layout as everyone else - you can really only customize your bio, profile pic, and I guess that thing some people do with their stories. Maybe this'll come along like a 90s trend, like people having nostalgia for the charming personal feel of the old internet - before companies had websites and the internet really was just a museum of personal interests and creativity. The websites were simple and shitty, but maybe on some level that made it feel more personal, like how handmade pottery is perfectly imperfect. But I wasn't really alive, so that's all just speculation. I guess the whole thesis around this, is, it used to be hard to make a truly personalized template free website, so people used the convenience of setting up a social media account as their digital footprint. But now ai can resolve that, making the internet way more personalized. I've seen the creativity that goes into a girl's instagram story - now imagine if they werent restricted to 1080x1920px and simple photo editing tools. Hmmmm, not as excited about this anymore, kinda feels like im reinventing the internet

    2/5/25 6:19pm Winston Churchill said it's unnecesary to grow a whole animal just to eat a couple parts of it, and cellular agriculture supporters have made it their mantra. But the better solution, and the way nature has always done it, is to grow the meat in the real organism (which is way more energy and waste efficient than a lab, thanks to evolution) and eat the entirety of the organism instead of just eating a couple parts of it.

    2/4/25 9:47pm Like prediabetes, we'll start diagnosing people with prealzheimers, precancer, etc...I wonder if prediabetes came before cgms...either way cgms definitely led to an increase in diagnoses.

    2/4/25 7:33pm Its already becoming somewhat clear that the next gen of wearable devices is implantable devices. Im unsure if I should keep fucking around with wearables or just go straight to implantables

    2/3/25 5:37pm I always thought that life's mechanisms are in a constant fight against entropy, and that entropy eventually accumulates faster than an organism can export it. I always thought that this entropy accumulation was manifested in things like DNA mutations, but I realized the thermodynamic implications of the correct DNA sequence vs a point mutation are the same.

    11/20/24 12:525pm The farthest future I can think of right now for diagnostics is continuous in vivo RNAseq for every cell in your body. I've only thought about it for a couple minutes, but I don't think it gets more advanced than that. Maybe there's something more advanced you can do with the DNA itself, but I think RNAseq is more effective because it includes expression. Obvisouly you can continue to innovate on the ways you analyze this data, and you can also continue innovating on RNAseq until maybe it isn't called RNA seq anymore, but the technology would sitll be based around the exposome.

    9/20/24 2:00pm The fda can't approave a drug for general longevity because there isn't yet a widely accepted metric for longevity (like Hba1c or body weight for diabetes). But this implies there's a mechanism behind actually extending life, as opposed to delaying the onset of disease->death

    8/28/24 10:28pm I was thinking about this phenomenon that for every semi-big groupchat there’s a bunch of smaller group chats with ~20% of the people in the big one and they control the background and once they reach a conclusion it gets published to the big groupchat. Anyways, how big does that first big groupchat have to be to have the break off ones - I’m guessing n=5. But it’s likely some function where as n increases, the probability/average number of breakoff groups increases exponentially, and then flattens out?

    8/26/24 9:53pm Everyone my age has a thing. The thing you spend 10-20 hours a week on that isn't directly school/career related. Some common ones are going to the gym, being in a frat, dating your girlf, building something. This is what defines people. If you want to know who someone really is, figure out what their thing is. It also makes sense that the biggest differences between people are minimally affected by how well they do the school/career related stuff, but is mainly a result of differences between how they spend those 10-20 hours a week. And if you're really obsessed, you'll spend more than 10-20 hours a week, and differences will become even more drastic.

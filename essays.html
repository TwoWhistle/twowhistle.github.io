  <h1 style="font-family:verdana">mental health</h1>
  <p style="font-family:verdana; margin-left: 50px;">Mental health had its moment five years ago, but it was executed terribly. What could’ve been the next frontier in human augmentation instead materialized as a couple of apps, TED talks, and podcasts. <br><br>

It’s time for someone to take advantage of the significance of mental health, and this time it won't be done by psych majors but  some fucking engineers.<br><br>

I don’t think I need to reiterate an argument on the importance of mental health, but I’ll emphasize a couple of key points regarding how I view mental health:<br>

- Forgive me for being too philosophical, but the importance of mental health for me lies in the fact that the brain is the medium through which we experience life, so it follows that improving the medium through which you experience life improves your experience of life.<br>
- Mental health should be seen as the foundation for high performance, not an excuse for self-coddling. I’m very cautious about how easily it can slip into justifying complacency (credit to weihong).<br>
  - I want to make that point clear. Mental health optimization is only worth pursuing for those who use it to do great things.<br><br> 

In the field of wearables, if your focus isn’t clinical use but general health and wellness, I think one of the biggest issues you face is stickiness—I’m a total health nut with the magnetic implant and nootropic stack to speak for it, and I probably have never felt the need to wear a fitness tracker for more than a month straight. But I’d argue that the stickiest features in a wellness wearable are insights related to brain function—specifically cognitive performance and emotional regulation. <br><br>

There are plenty of examples that provide hints for this interest in brain function. Take the widespread interest in sleep tracking—people are ultimately so obsessed with their sleep quality because of the direct effects on brain function, as provided in Oura’s readiness score, for example. Another example is the rising interest in the galvanic skin response (GSR). GSR is the health tracking companies’ latest feature aimed at detecting stress. But GSR is just a downstream effect of emotional stress generated by the brain to trigger sympathetic activity.<br><br>

The world has taken on an obsession with "optimization" — optimizing sleep, productivity, focus, longevity. Yet mental health often gets sidelined as something separate, like a side quest rather than the core objective. The irony is wild because cognitive and emotional well-being are the ultimate productivity hacks. What’s the point of tracking sleep stages if you wake up anxious or uninspired?<br><br>

The ultimate goal for users in this field would be to achieve far deeper self-regulation—to understand their cognitive patterns, emotional triggers, and physiological responses in real-time and actually do something with that knowledge. Not a notification that says, "You seem stressed. Take a deep breath." (Thanks, Apple. Groundbreaking.) But actionable, personalized insights: <i>You’re trending 25% slower on task switching after lunch. It might be worth adjusting your meals—last time you ate lighter, you stayed sharp longer. </i><br><br>

And when someone builds it right and makes mental health the core objective, they’ll shift it from something we manage just to get by into something we optimize to thrive—empowering people to unlock their full potential, not just avoid burnout.

  <h1 style="font-family:verdana">medicine 3.0</h1>
  <p style="font-family:verdana; margin-left: 50px;">Within the literature and twitter, there’s a clear picture of where the field of biosensing is going. <br>

1. We’re racing to develop more sensitive, smaller, and more integrated sensors that can measure a wider array of biological markers in real time - this provides an unprecedented volume of physiological data (slow, rate limiting step). <br>
2. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will churn through those data, extracting meaningful patterns about every measurable process in your body.<br>
3. The result is a constant “biometric mirror” of our bodies - every part of your life will be represented in data harvested from these sensors.<br>
4. Diagnosing and preventing disease no longer requires a medical degree - it becomes a data science problem best solved by AI and engineers. For those worried, a medical education may still be useful in the treatment of disease.<br>

Yeah so I’d say 1 and 2 are widely agreed upon, 3 and 4 are my opinions but they’re definitely shared by many others. <br><br>

Pro-Lo-Fo, bro. Tech bros keep talking about this new Proactive-Longevity-Focused healthcare system. Peter Attia calls it medicine 3.0. I’m getting tired of the whole idea that our healthcare system is focused on reactive medicine, not proactive medicine.<br><br>

Framework shifts are fun to talk about—buzzwords get thrown around, TED Talks get made—but the only thing that actually moves the needle is technology. The problem with our current healthcare system is not an issue of approach but of hard technological breakthroughs. The moment of diagnosis shifts earlier when the sensors get better, not when we decide to label our healthcare philosophy as “proactive.”<br><br>

Here’s the bottleneck: the body’s path to disease starts long before traditional medicine notices anything. A cell goes rogue. An inflammatory pathway turns hyperactive. A metabolic process derails. Right now, we don’t catch those events until they’ve snowballed into symptoms or detectable clinical markers. What biosensing will do is bring us earlier into that picture.<br><br>

The way forward is clear if you’ve been following the space. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) were the first mainstream example—originally designed for diabetics, now used by health-conscious tech bros to optimize their oatmeal consumption. But glucose is just one marker. <br><br>
